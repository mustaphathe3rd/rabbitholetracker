Identify the single biggest time-sink or \"rabbithole\" domain.\n2.  Suggest a potential reason *why* the user might be spending so much time there (e.g., \"It seems you use Gemini for deep research, which is great, but can lead to long sessions.\").\n3.  Provide a unique and creative suggestion to help them manage their time on that specific site, going beyond generic advice like \"use a timer\".\n\nCombine these points into a single, friendly paragraph of about 100 words."
